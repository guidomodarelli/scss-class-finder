# 🔍 SCSS Class Finder

VS Code extension to find SCSS classes by their **resolved selector**, handling nesting and `&` (parent selector).

When working with deeply nested SCSS, the actual CSS selector can be hard to trace back to its source. This extension resolves all selectors in your workspace and lets you search by the final compiled form.

## ✨ Features

- 🔗 **Resolves nested selectors** — `&`-based concatenation (`&-header`, `&.active`, `&:hover`), multi-level nesting, and descendant selectors.
- 📋 **Comma-separated selector lists** — `.a, .b { &-x }` correctly expands to `.a-x` and `.b-x`.
- 🎯 **Smart matching** — results are filtered to **exact** and **endsWith** matches only, avoiding noisy partial hits.
- 👁️ **Live preview** — navigating the results list previews each match in the editor.
- ✏️ **Cursor-aware** — pre-fills the search input with the word under the cursor.
- 🚫 **Skips noise** — ignores `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, and `coverage` directories.
- 🧩 **Handles edge cases** — comments, strings, `@media`/`@supports` at-rules, and `#{}` interpolation.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Press `Cmd+Alt+F` (macOS) / `Ctrl+Alt+F` (Windows/Linux), or run the command **SCSS: Find Class by Resolved Selector** from the Command Palette.
2. Type the class name (e.g. `bodyCard-header`). The leading `.` is added automatically if omitted.
3. Browse the results — exact matches appear first, followed by endsWith matches.
4. Select a result to jump to its definition.

## 🏷️ Match Types

| Icon | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| ✅ | **exact** | Resolved selector equals the search term exactly |
| ➡️ | **endsWith** | Resolved selector ends with the search term as a separate segment (e.g. `.parent .child` matches `.child`) |

## ⚙️ Settings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `scssClassFinder.previewOnResultFocus` | `boolean` | `true` | Automatically preview and reveal the selected result while navigating the results list |
